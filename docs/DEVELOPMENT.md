## Help and resources

## Testing distribution, LibreOffice and flatpak

### Linux

Look in Makefile to test flatpak, usually from CLI can be
invoked via

 flatpak run org.libreoffice.LibreOffice

LibreOffice distributes packages that do not clash with distro
packages. Are installed in /opt/libreofficeYY.M/program/

Linux distribution binaries are usually in /usr/bin

Envvars can be changed with

PREFIX : By default point to /usr/bin , can be changed to /opt/libre...
UNOPKG : The name of the extension installer
LOBIN : The name of LibreOffice executable


### Interaction

* [üí¨ irc #libreoffice-dev](https://web.libera.chat)
* [üêõ reporting bugs to libreoffice](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/)
* [üôã forum](https://ask.libreoffice.org/)

### Local documentation

* file:///usr/share/doc/libreoffice-dev-doc/api/
* file:///usr/lib/libreoffice/share/Scripts/python/
* file:///usr/lib/libreoffice/sdk/examples/html


## Helpers

Install apso and use the python console that comes with it, easier
to get help from there.

### Some recipes

#### Ways to get context

```
doc = XSCRIPTCONTEXT.getDocument()
doc.get_current_controller().ComponentWindow.StyleSettings.LightColor.is_dark()

ctx = uno.getComponentContext()
uno.getComponentContext().getServiceManager().createInstanceWithContext("com.sun.star.frame.Desktop", ctx)
```
