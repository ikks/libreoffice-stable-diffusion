## StableHorde

This plugin can be used without running a stable-diffusion server
yourself. It uses [StableHorde](https://stablehorde.net)
as the backend. StableHorde is a cluster of
stable-diffusion servers run by volunteers. [Check it
out](https://github.com/blueturtleai/gimp-stable-diffusion/tree/main/stablehorde).

Head to [instructions](/docs/README.md).

You can join [Discord](https://discord.gg/3DxrhksKzn), to find someone to
help you using StableHorde or the plugin itself.  Have fun with your prompts
and the results from thousands of years of experiences and thoughts.
